# ADS1232/ADS1234
ADS1232/ADS1234 Arduino Library

Here is an Arduino Library for ADS1232/ADS1234.

Features:

- usage of the 1st differential input.
- usage of the onboard oscillator.

Missing features:

- this library doens't support reading from 2nd (3rd & 4th for ADS1234) differential input.
- offset calibration
- sleep mode

Below you can see some pictures from test circuit and a Fritzing diagram.

For test circuit I've used **CJMCU-1232** development board and Arduino UNO.
